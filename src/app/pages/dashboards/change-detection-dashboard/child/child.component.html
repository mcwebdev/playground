    The bare minimum for using highlight.js on a web page is linking to the library along with one of the styles and calling
    <a href="http://highlightjs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#inithighlightingonload"><code>initHighlightingOnLoad</code></a
    >:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;/path/to/styles/default.css&quot;&gt;
  &lt;script src=&quot;/path/to/highlight.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script&gt;hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad();&lt;/script&gt;
  </code></pre>
  <p>
    This will find and highlight code inside of <code>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;</code> tags; it tries to detect the language automatically. If
    automatic detection doesnâ€™t work for you, you can specify the language in the <code>class</code> attribute:
  </p>
  <pre><code class="language-html">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;html&quot;&gt;...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
  </code></pre>

    // When using changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush, the component will only be

    // property changes.
    
    // if you were to setup breakpoints on the code below, you would observe 
    // => this.message.text = 'Updated message'; 
    // however you will not see it render in the view because you did not update the object reference.

<p>
    In Angular, ChangeDetectionStrategy is a concept that determines how and when
    Angular checks for changes in component data and updates the view accordingly.
    There are two main change detection strategies: Default and OnPush.
</p>

<h3>Default Change Detection Strategy:</h3>
<p>
    This is the default behavior of Angular's change detection. In this strategy,
    Angular automatically checks for changes in component data during various
    events like user interactions, HTTP requests, timers, etc. Any change in the
    component's data will trigger a re-evaluation of the template and update the
    view accordingly.
</p>

<h3>OnPush Change Detection Strategy:</h3>
<p>
    With the OnPush strategy, Angular only checks for changes if the component's
    input properties (@Input) change, or if an event bound with @Output emits an
    event. This can lead to significant performance improvements, especially in
    applications with complex component trees or heavy rendering.
</p>

<p>
    Using the <strong>OnPush</strong> strategy requires careful management of
    component state to ensure that changes are propagated correctly. It's
    effective when the component's data doesn't change frequently and can lead to
    better performance due to fewer change detection checks.
</p>

<p>
    In addition to these strategies, you can also create custom change detection
    strategies if needed. The choice of strategy depends on the specific
    requirements of your application and the nature of your components' data and
    interactions.
