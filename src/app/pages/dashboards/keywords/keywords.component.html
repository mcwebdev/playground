    <p>In programming, particularly in JavaScript and its associated frameworks such as Angular, the Promise pattern is
        a
        popular way to handle asynchronous operations. Here are some keywords and concepts that are compatible or
        associated
        with the Promise pattern:</p>
    <pre><code class="" [highlight]="code"></code></pre>
    <div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Promise:</strong>
            <p> A proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is created. It allows you to associate
                handlers with
                an asynchronous action's eventual success value or failure reason.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>then():</strong>
            <p> A method to specify what to do when the Promise resolves.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>catch():</strong>
            <p> A method to handle errors in a Promise chain.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>finally():</strong>
            <p> A method to specify final code to run after the Promise resolves or rejects.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>async/await:</strong>
            <p> Modern syntax to work with Promises in a more comfortable, synchronous-like manner.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Promise.all():</strong>
            <p> A method to wait for all promises to resolve.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Promise.race():</strong>
            <p> A method to wait for the first promise to resolve or reject.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Promise.resolve():</strong>
            <p> A method to return a Promise that is resolved with a given value.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Promise.reject():</strong>
            <p> A method to return a Promise that is rejected with a given reason.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Executor Function:</strong>
            <p> A function passed to the Promise constructor, which is executed immediately and receives resolve and
                reject
                functions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Settled:</strong>
            <p> The state of a Promise after it has either been fulfilled or rejected.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Pending:</strong>
            <p> The initial state of a Promise, neither fulfilled nor rejected.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Fulfilled:</strong>
            <p> The state of a Promise representing a successful operation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Rejected:</strong>
            <p> The state of a Promise representing a failed operation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="keyword"><strong>Chaining:</strong>
            <p> The process of linking together Promises by having a Promise return another Promise.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
